    Community Health Workers (CHWs) are recognized leaders and trusted members of the communities where they live and work. The CHW career path follows one of service, advocacy, and social justice. Through their work, CHWs are both protagonists and companions for those who are part of the cycle of community transformation, which begins with individuals, and extends to communities and ultimately to systems. CHWs are agents of change who help reduce disparities at all levels by acting as a bridge that connects socioeconomic, political, and health systems and resources to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged populations

    Promotores are now recognized by various health and government agencies as an integral link between communities, resources, and existing services and systems. For example, <strong style={{color: '#067CBC'}}>the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)</strong>,  which is in charge of detecting and responding to new and emerging health threats in the United States, defines CHWs as “trained public health workers who serve as a bridge between communities, health care systems, and state health departments.”

    They usually share many things in common with these communities, which can be language, customs, cuisine, cultural traditions, and sometimes similar life experiences. This gives them invaluable insight into the struggles and challenges that these communities face and the importance of working collectively to address those challenges and achieve a better quality of life for all.

This transformation happens when:

<p>
1 - Strong and meaningful relationships are built through community outreach, peer support, one-on-one meetings, solidarity, and constant partnership.
 <br></br>
 <br></br>
2 - Individual and collective capacity building is supported through educational workshops, informational materials, resources, and mutual exchange of experiences and knowledge.

3 - Community engagement is promoted through awareness, individual, and collective leadership development that leads us to advocacy and action.

    CHWs have existed in different parts of the world since the 1800s. They have had many names and roles including feldshers, barefoot doctors, village health workers, community organizers, community health promoters, health advisors, community advocates, representatives and more. Whatever their role or name, the nature of their work remains the same: advocating for the rights of the most vulnerable and being part of the process of empowering communities to advocate for themselves and obtain the socioeconomic, health, and political representation they deserve.

    CHWs have been around for hundreds of years. Their work has a long history dating back to the 19th century with origins in Asia, namely Russia and China. From barefoot doctors walking through rice paddies to provide medical care to political activists advocating for free clinics, CHWs have a rich history that spans the globe. Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) has not only recognized CHWs as an integral component of public health but continues to support these government-sponsored programs as part of its mission to bring health to all.

    In other occupations, CHWs may also provide direct services such as first aid, psychological intervention (one-on-one), crisis intervention, and diabetes or blood pressure screening.  
<br></br>
<br></br>
CHWs are always willing to facilitate the learning process of others, to listen to the community, to accompany the community, to advocate for individuals to obtain culturally appropriate resources, and to strive to build strong relationships with communities. CHWs carry a passion for service in their hearts and their commitment lies not only with the communities where they live and work but also with each person who comes to them seeking comfort and understanding.

</div>
<div className='row'>
    <p>
A code of ethics is a set of standards designed to help CHWs/Ps discuss ethical issues facing the profession. The CHW Code of Ethics can be used by CHWs/Ps, supervisors, and employers. According to the American Association of Community Health Workers Code of Ethics, a code of ethics is based upon commonly understood assumptions that are applied to all professionals within the health and social service field.
<br></br>
<br></br>
The primary mission of the CHW/P profession is to reduce social inequality and promote equity through relationship building, integrity, empowerment, teamwork, and compassion. The code of ethics guides decision-making and conduct when an ethical issue appears as CHWs/Ps work within complex systems and various populations.
<br></br>
<br></br>
The code of ethics, however, is not legally binding but is used to encourage CHWs/Ps to reflect on the ethical obligations that they have to the communities they serve. The CHWs Code of Ethics is formed by four articles and sub-articles that focus on Responsibility in the Delivery of Care, Promotion of Equitable Relationships, Interactions with Other Service Providers, and Professional Rights and Responsibilities.
<br></br>
